# ChallengeAcessEvent
Project Summary
Welcome to my project! The goal of this project is to create an NHS Local Government Patient Portal that is compliant with client requirements and flexible enough to be rolled out to other Local Authorities. The project involves developing a simple but effective prototype product that will allow patients to access their data from a Case Management System and the ICB team to manage patient access.

The challenge event was set up by a company called Access. Our groups tackled the problem in their own way, considering various aspects of the proposed solution such as strategy, costs, time estimates, dependencies, sequencing of activity, risks, and rollout. The proposed solutions were judged based on their ability to address all components of the problem, both business and technical, and demonstrate innovative thinking and consideration of the client's needs.

During the challenge event, student groups were given a limited amount of time to create a prototype that complied with the client requirements and had the flexibility to be rolled out to other Local Authorities. Given the time constraints, the groups had to focus on creating a basic prototype that demonstrated the key functionalities of the proposed solution. To expedite the process of creating the prototype, our group decided to develop a mobile application instead of a web application since it allowed us to produce a minimum viable product (MVP) more quickly. Despite the limitations imposed by the time constraints, our group was able to successfully create a functional prototype that addressed the client's requirements and showcased the potential of the proposed solution.
